## doom-one-alternative-theme

#### This file is just a little modification to the already-wonderful doom-one-theme found at https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes.

#### In short:
* Yellow is "more yellow," and less of a dull orange color.
* Magenta has less contrast, making it fit in with the rest of the colors more (in my opinion)
* Function definitions are Red instead of Magenta now (since there is already a lot of magenta/violet/purple/etc. used for other things)

#### To install:
* Simply replace the old doom-one-theme.el (usually found in `.emacs.d/elpa/doom-themes-<some_date_and_version>`) with this one and you're good to go

##### And finally:
* For i3wm users interested in a mixed doom-one + arc-dark desktop theme check out my dotfiles at: https://github.com/ColtonPowell/dotfiles
